# Privacy Policy — YouTube PiP

**Last updated:** February 16, 2026

## Overview

YouTube PiP is a browser extension that adds a Picture-in-Picture button to
the YouTube video player. It is designed with privacy in mind and collects
**no personal data whatsoever**.

## Data Collection

This extension does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data,
browsing history, or usage analytics.

## Data Storage

The only data stored by this extension is:

- **PiP window size** (width and height in pixels) — saved locally on your
  device using Chrome's `storage.local` API so the browser can remember your
  preferred PiP window dimensions between sessions.

This data:
- Is stored **only on your local device**.
- Is **never transmitted** to any server, third party, or remote endpoint.
- Can be cleared at any time by removing the extension or clearing extension
  storage via `chrome://extensions`.

## Permissions

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** communicate with any third-party services,
analytics platforms, or remote servers.
